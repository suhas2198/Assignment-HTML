    <h2>Information about cricket</h2>
    <P>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of which
        is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
        game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of
        the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six
        times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the
        pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs when either the bowler
        unfairly bowls the ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or the two batters swap ends
        of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each
        batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled,
        when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit
        ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line
        in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams
        swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that scored more runs wins, provided that the other team has
        completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and
        match referee in international matches.

        Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs and the game
        generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white
        kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players
        wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed
        leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.

        The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the
        expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century.
        The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of
        which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by
        Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United
        Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies.[1]

        Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most
        successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies,
        including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other
        country.</P>
